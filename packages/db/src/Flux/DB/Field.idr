||| Per-field, single-column encode/decode typeclasses - the piece
||| `Derive.PGRow`'s `FromRow`/`ToRow` derivation chains together per
||| record field. Deliberately separate from `Data.PGValue`'s `getText`/
||| `getInt`/etc: those stay the low-level, no-typeclass-dispatch API;
||| this module is the new, opt-in layer built on top of them.

||| The piece none of `Data.PGValue`'s raw getters support: a SQL NULL
