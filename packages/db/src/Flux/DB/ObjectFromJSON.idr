||| A `FromJSON` derivation that always decodes a single-constructor
||| record as a plain JSON object (`{"field": value, ...}`), regardless
||| of field count.
|||
||| `json-simple`'s own `FromJSON` derive special-cases exactly one field
||| as a "newtype" and unwraps it to the bare value (`"value"` instead of
||| `{"field":"value"}`) - confirmed directly (not assumed) via a minimal
||| standalone repro against this exact library version: a 2-field
||| record derives correctly, only the 1-field case does this. Reading
||| `Derive.FromJSON.Simple`'s own source confirms it, too - single-field
||| unwrapping happens unconditionally in its `decRecord` (the plain,
||| untagged-record path every single-constructor type goes through by
||| default), with no `Options` flag able to turn it off without also
||| switching to sum-type-shaped tagging (`{"tag":...,"contents":...}`),
||| which isn't what a single-field API body wants either.
|||
||| This derivation is deliberately independent of `flux-postgres`'s
||| `Flux.DB.Derive.ActiveRecord` - it's plain JSON, with no DB coupling at
||| all - but is written the same way and is meant to compose with
||| `flux-postgres`'s `deriveSubset` the same way `FromRow`/`ToRow`/
||| `elab-util`'s `Show`/`Eq` do: pass `[ObjectFromJSON]` as `deriveSubset`'s
||| `derives` argument to get a companion type's JSON body decoded this
||| way instead of through `json-simple`'s own `FromJSON`.
