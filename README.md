# nebula

A derivable active-record layer, typed query builder, and repository
pattern for Idris2 apps - `Row`<->record mapping, generated CRUD, a
typed `SELECT` builder, and a generic `Repository` every app can extend
with its own domain-specific operations. Built
on [idris2-pg](../idris2-pg) today; idris2-pg itself stays a primitive
Postgres wire-protocol client only - everything that maps a `Row` onto
an application record type lives here instead, so it isn't tied to one
backend forever (see "Backends" below). Deliberately has no dependency
on any HTTP framework - see [nebula-flux](../nebula-flux) for the
[Flux](../../projects/flux) adapter (`dbIO`/`query`/`command`/
`decodeRows`/`decodeOne`/`requireId`), split into its own package so a
consumer that only wants this active-record/query-builder layer isn't
forced to pull in Flux and its own dependency tree too.

## Why this exists

An app using idris2-pg directly would otherwise hand-write, per project:
the `Row`<->record decode/encode boilerplate for every table, the basic
CRUD calls, and a `CREATE TABLE` for each type. None of that is
app-specific - no schema, no routes, no handlers - so it belongs in a
shared library instead of being re-derived per project. `todo-api`
(`~/dev/idris2/playground/todo-api`) is the first real consumer; this
library exists so the second one doesn't re-derive any of it.

## Active-record layer: deriving `Row`<->record mapping and CRUD

For the common case - a record type that maps one-to-one onto a table -
`%runElab derive` can generate the `Row` decoding/encoding and the basic
CRUD calls, instead of hand-writing them per type:

```idris
import Data.PGField
import Data.PGRow
import Data.PGTable
import Derive.PGActiveRecord
import Data.PGCrud

%language ElabReflection

record User where
  constructor MkUser
  id    : Integer
  name  : String
  email : String

%runElab derive "User" [FromRow, ToRow, Table]
%runElab deriveInsertable Nothing "User"

main : IO ()
main = do
  Right db <- connectDB (mkPGConfig "127.0.0.1" 5432 "myuser" "mypassword" "mydb")
    | Left err => putStrLn (displayError err)
  Right user   <- insert db (MkNewUser "Ada" "ada@example.com")
    | Left err => putStrLn (displayError err)
  Right mFound <- findById {a = User} db user.id
    | Left err => putStrLn (displayError err)
  closeDB db
```

- **`FromRow`/`ToRow`** (`Data.PGRow`) decode/encode one field at a time,
  via a `FromField`/`ToField` typeclass (`Data.PGField`) with instances
  for `String`/`Int`/`Integer`/`Double`/`Bool`, plus a blanket
  `FromField a => FromField (Maybe a)`/`ToField a => ToField (Maybe a)`
  that maps SQL `NULL` to `Nothing` (something none of idris2-pg's raw
  `Data.PGValue` getters do on their own).
- **`Table`** (`Data.PGTable`) generates static per-type metadata - table
  name, column list, primary-key column - plus the four fixed SQL
  strings the CRUD calls below run, computed once at compile time so
  they're literal, byte-identical every call (this matters: idris2-pg's
  `DB` prepared-statement cache is keyed by exact SQL text). Table name
  defaults to the exact-lowercase type name (`User` → `"user"`) - no
  pluralization guessing - and the primary key defaults to a field
  literally named `id`; override either with `customTable`:
  `customTable Export (Just "users") Nothing []` in place of `Table` in
  the derive list, for a table name that doesn't match the type name.
- **`Table` also generates `createTableSql`** - a real
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` - via `Data.PGColumnType`, a typeclass
  mapping an Idris type to its column type
  (`String`/`Bool`/`Int`/`Integer`/`Double`, `Maybe a` for a nullable
  column; add your own instance for a type of your own, e.g. an enum
  stored as `TEXT`). Unlike `Table`'s other SQL strings, this one is a
  genuine runtime-dispatched value, not a compile-time literal - DDL
  normally runs once at startup, so the prepared-statement-cache
  argument above doesn't apply, and a real typeclass means you aren't
  limited to types this library already knows about. The primary key
  gets `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL` if its type has one (`Int`/`Integer`); a
  type without an auto-increment form (a `String` UUID/slug key, say)
  falls back to its plain column type plus `PRIMARY KEY`. `customTable`'s
  fourth argument, `columnDefaults : List (String, String)` (column name
  → raw SQL default expression), adds a real `DEFAULT` clause -
  `customTable Export Nothing Nothing [("done", "false")]` generates
  `done BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false`. (This design deliberately
  mirrors [Drift](https://github.com/simolus3/drift)'s own two-defaults
  split for Dart/SQLite: `columnDefaults` is Drift's `withDefault()` - a
  real DB-level default; `deriveInsertable`'s pk-less companion record,
  below, is nebula's equivalent of Drift's `clientDefault()` - an
  application-side default needing no schema support, since the caller
  always supplies every field of the companion type explicitly.)
  No migrations, and no other constraints (`UNIQUE`/`CHECK`/foreign
  keys) - `createTableSql` only ever runs on a fresh table
  (`IF NOT EXISTS`), so a later change to a type's fields won't `ALTER`
  an existing one; for anything past the structural common case, write
  real SQL/migrations by hand, same as always.
- **`deriveSubset`** generates a companion record containing only the
  named fields you list - an INCLUDE-list, not an exclude-list - plus
  runs any `derive`-style items you like against it:
  `deriveSubset ["title","done"] "TodoUpdate" [FromJSON] "Todo"` declares
  `TodoUpdate`/`MkTodoUpdate` (with real field accessors - `tu.title`
  works, same as if you'd hand-written the record) and a `FromJSON
  TodoUpdate` instance, in one line. `derives` can be anything
  `derive`-shaped - this module's own `FromRow`/`ToRow`, `elab-util`'s
  `Show`/`Eq`, `json-simple`'s `FromJSON`/`ToJSON`, not just nebula's
  own. Deliberately inclusive by default: something built from untrusted
  input (an HTTP request body, say) shouldn't silently gain a new
  accepted field just because the original record gained a column.
- **`deriveInsertable`** is `deriveSubset` specialized the other way -
  every field EXCEPT `pk` (default `"id"`) - for `insert`'s companion
  record (`New<Type>`, e.g. `NewUser`): Postgres assigns the real `id`
  (`SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL`, if `Table`'s generated `createTableSql` is
  what created the table), so there's no real value to put in one, and
  a separate type means you can't accidentally pass a stray id that gets
  silently ignored. Excluding the pk is the one place an exclude-shape
  still makes sense; `deriveSubset` itself stays include-only.
  Both are a genuinely different kind of derivation from `FromRow`/
  `ToRow`/`Table` above: they declare a brand new record type (not just
  an instance for an existing one), so each is its own standalone
  `%runElab` line, not one more item in `derive`'s own list - see the
  doc comments in `Derive.PGActiveRecord` for why, and for a real
  Idris2-elaborator gotcha this surfaced (two reflection-declared
  records sharing a field name collide unless each is given its own
  nested namespace, same as a normal `record` block gets implicitly).
- **`Data.PGCrud`** provides the actual CRUD calls, generic over any
  `Table`/`FromRow`/`ToRow`/`Insertable` instance rather than
  per-type-generated: `insert`, `findById`, `update` (whole-record
  replace of every non-pk column), `deleteById`. "Not found" is
  `Right Nothing`/`Right False`, not an error. `findById`/`deleteById`
  don't take the target type as an argument, so a call site needs
  `{a = User}`.
- **`deriveColumns`** + **`Data.PGQuery`** - a typed `SELECT` query
  builder, inspired by [Drift](https://github.com/simolus3/drift) (Dart/
  SQLite)'s `select(table)..where(...)..orderBy(...)..limit(...)`.
  `%runElab deriveColumns "User"` generates `UserColumns`/`userColumns`
  (typed column references - `userColumns.email : Column User String`,
  with real field accessors, the same `IRecord`+namespace mechanism
  `deriveSubset`/`deriveInsertable` already use), and
  `userColumns.email ==. "ada@example.com"` builds a `Condition User`
  via hand-written operators (`==.`/`/=.`/`<.`/`>.`/`<=.`/`>=.`/`&&.`/
  `||.`/`isNull`/`isNotNull`/`not_` - confirmed directly that Idris2 has
  no reflection mechanism to *generate* new infix operators, so these
  are ordinary source, not code-generated). Compose a `Query` with
  `selectAll |> where_ cond |> orderByAsc userColumns.name |> limit 10`,
  run it with `selectQuery : (Table a, FromRow a) => DB -> Query a -> IO
  (Either PGError (List a))` - which, like every other `IO (Either
  PGError a)`-shaped call in this library, composes with `dbIO` (below)
  inside a Flux handler with zero extra glue needed. `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` are
  `$N` placeholders, not literals, so paging through the same
  filtered/sorted query reuses one `DB.stmtCache` entry instead of
  minting a new one per page. Single-table only - no JOINs, no raw-SQL
  escape hatch, no `LIKE` (a clean later addition, same shape as the
  comparison operators). `insert`/by-pk `update`/`deleteById` (above) are
  unaffected; a bulk `updateWhere`/`deleteWhere` by condition would reuse
  `compileCondition` cheaply as a later addition, not built yet.

Deliberately out of scope: no relations/joins, no migrations, no
partial-update/PATCH, and no dedicated error case for constraint
violations (inspect idris2-pg's `SqlError`'s `code`/`constraintName`
yourself, same as always). This is meant for the common "one record, one
table, basic CRUD plus simple filtering" case - anything more exotic
still goes through idris2-pg's own `queryRows`/`execCommand` directly.

## Repository pattern: `Data.PGRepository`

A generic CRUD+query repository, bound to one `DB` connection - the same
integration pattern every app gets for free, instead of handlers taking
a raw `DB` directly:

```idris
import Data.PGRepository

getUser : DB -> Integer -> IO (Either PGError (Maybe User))
getUser db uid =
  let repo := pgRepository {ins = NewUser} db
   in repo.findById uid
```

```idris
public export
record Repository pk a ins where
  constructor MkRepository
  findById   : pk -> IO (Either PGError (Maybe a))
  insert     : ins -> IO (Either PGError a)
  update     : a -> IO (Either PGError (Maybe a))
  deleteById : pk -> IO (Either PGError Bool)
  query      : Query a -> IO (Either PGError (List a))
```

- **A plain record of functions, not an interface.** A caller is handed
  exactly the implementation it needs explicitly - `pgRepository db` (the
  real, Postgres-backed one below), or an app's own in-memory test
  double of the same shape - rather than relying on Idris2's global
  instance search to pick the right one. This is what actually makes the
  pattern useful for tests: a handler written against `Repository a ins`
  (or an app's own extension of it - see `todo-api`'s `TodoRepository`,
  which embeds this plus a hand-written `toggle`) doesn't care which
  value it's given.
- **`pgRepository`** builds the real implementation for free, once a
  type has the `Table`/`FromRow`/`ToRow`/`Insertable ins a` instances
  `%runElab derive [...]` already generates - every field just delegates
  to `Data.PGCrud`'s generic CRUD helpers and `Data.PGQuery.selectQuery`.
- **HTTP-independent on purpose.** Every operation returns a plain
  `IO (Either PGError _)` - no `Context`/status codes/`AppProg`. A
  handler (in [nebula-flux](../nebula-flux) or an app) decides what a
  `Nothing`/`False`/`Left` becomes (a 404, a 500, ...); the repository
  just reports what happened. `Nebula.PG.dbIO` already lifts any of
  these into `AppProg` unchanged, the same way it already lifts
  `Data.PGCrud`'s own functions - no `nebula-flux` changes were needed
  to add this.
- **The primary key (`pk`) is generic**, matching `Data.PGCrud.findById`/
  `deleteById`'s own genericity over the same name - any type with a
  `ToField` instance works. `Data.PGField` already has one for `String`,
  so a UUID/slug key stored as text works today with no new code needed
  anywhere underneath this. Most apps still use `Integer`
  (`SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL`) - `nebula-flux`'s `requireId` stays
  `Integer`-only for exactly that reason (not generalized speculatively
  ahead of a real non-`Integer`-keyed consumer); an app that needs one
  reads its own path param as whatever type it needs and calls
  `repo.findById`/`repo.deleteById` directly - no `nebula-flux` change
  required for that to already work.
- **An app's own domain-specific operations aren't here.** `Data.PGCrud`
  has no "list all"/partial-update primitive, so an app needing e.g. a
  partial update builds its own hand-written-SQL extension on top of
  this, reusing the now-exported `Data.PGCrud.decodeFirst` (the same
  "decode a single optional row" helper `findById`/`update` use
  internally) instead of duplicating it - see `todo-api`'s
  `TodoRepository.toggle` for a worked example. Nebula supplies the
  generic piece and this extension point; the domain-specific operation
  itself is each app's own.

### Transactions: `withTransactionRepos`

```idris
export
withTransactionRepos : DB -> (DB -> repos) -> (repos -> IO (Either PGError a)) -> IO (Either PGError a)
```

Repositories are just values closing over a `DB` - `repo.findById`/etc
already participate in whatever Postgres transaction is active on that
connection (transactions are connection-scoped, not value-scoped), so
nothing *new* was needed for that part. What was missing was a
contract-level way to say "these operations run in one transaction",
instead of a caller manually threading `db`/idris2-pg's own
`withTransaction` around raw repository calls and hoping they never mix
in a repository built from a different connection.
`withTransactionRepos` wraps idris2-pg's `withTransaction` (BEGIN, then
COMMIT on `Right`/ROLLBACK on `Left`, no nesting) and hands the callback
repositories built via `mkRepos` from the SAME transactional connection
- a single repository, a tuple of several, or a record grouping many;
`mkRepos` decides the shape:

```idris
transferOwnership : DB -> Integer -> Integer -> IO (Either PGError ())
transferOwnership db widgetId newOwnerId =
  withTransactionRepos db
    (\txDb => (pgRepository {a = Widget} txDb, pgRepository {a = Owner} txDb))
    (\(widgetRepo, ownerRepo) => do
       ... -- both calls run in the same transaction; an error from
           -- either one rolls both back)
```

Verified against real Postgres (`nebula/test/src/Main.idr`'s
`testTransaction`, exercising `Widget`/`Gadget` together) for both
paths - reading through a SEPARATE connection from the one the
transaction itself ran on, so the check can't be fooled by read-your-
own-writes visibility on the transactional connection: a successful
callback commits writes across both tables (durably, visible from
elsewhere), and an error inside the callback - specifically after it
had already written successfully, not before - rolls back everything,
with `txStatus` back to `Idle` afterward either way.

## What this deliberately doesn't do

- **No relations/joins/migrations/partial-update** in the active-record
  layer - see "Active-record layer" above for the exact boundary.
- **No HTTP-framework glue in this package.** `dbIO`/`dbFail`/`query`/
  `command`/`decodeRows`/`decodeOne`/`requireId` - the functions that
  lift an `IO (Either PGError a)` call into a Flux handler - live in
  [nebula-flux](../nebula-flux) instead, so a consumer that only wants
  `Row`<->record mapping, CRUD, or the typed query builder isn't forced
  to depend on Flux at all.

## Backends

Built against [idris2-pg](../idris2-pg) today - `Table`/`Data.PGCrud`/
`Data.PGQuery`'s `selectQuery`/`Data.PGRepository`'s `Repository` are all
typed against idris2-pg's `DB`/`PGError`/`Row`. SQLite support is planned
next; the active-record/
query-builder design above (typeclass-driven `FromRow`/`ToRow`/`Table`/
`PGColumnType`, a hand-written condition/query AST rather than anything
idris2-pg-specific baked into the elaborator reflection) was kept
deliberately backend-agnostic in shape for exactly this, but the actual
multi-backend split (what stays shared vs. what becomes a
`Nebula.SQLite`-style per-backend module) hasn't been designed yet - not
speculatively built ahead of that work.

## Install / build

Requires [pack](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack).

```sh
pack build nebula.ipkg
```

## Running the tests

Needs a real Postgres - connection details come from
`PG_TEST_HOST`/`PG_TEST_PORT`/`PG_TEST_USER`/`PG_TEST_PASSWORD`/
`PG_TEST_DB`, defaulting to `127.0.0.1:5432`/`testuser`/`testpass`/
`testdb`:

```sh
docker run -d --name nebula-test \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=testuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpass -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16

cd test
pack build test.ipkg
./build/exec/nebula-test
```
